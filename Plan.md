# CGRA151 Project Plan

## Student name: Piper Inns Hall
## Student ID: 300668166
## Name of game/artwork: The Not-So-Grand Theft of Automobiles

## Vision

1. Game concept:
My game is an open-world top down action game set in a city that players can explore to their hearts content, filled with missions, side quests, and many automobiles to commandeer.
The player takes the role of a very kind and caring person who's one true dream in life is to own a car, and no one, not even the local police, can get in their way.
My game is all about freedom of choice, allowing the player to tacke many different situations in unique ways. Somewhat inspired by the GTA1, my game will mix top down action with modern elements.
The games cityscape is alive with opportunities, from hijacking vehicles and evading police chases to discovering hidden secrets, and the ultimate goal is finally owning a car of your own.                                            

2. Game play:
The design of the interaction that I plan to have will focus on fun and goofy experiences that the player can have. The control scheme will be minimal and simple, allowing for ease of use.
This means that players can easily perform combat, vehicle usage, and charachter movement, very easily. This makes for a fun, easy to get into and enjoyable experience.
The main gameplay will be combat and vehicle focused, sometimes merging elements of the 2. Interesting elements in my game will be interactive NPCs, and responsive environments.
Overall, the design of the interaction I plan to have focuses on simplicity, fun, and responsive gameplay. I hope to make a game I somewhat enjoy.

3. Visual design: 
The UI will be simplistic, and easy to understand, making use of imagery to convey a message to the player, rather than using text. This will make the game a very accessible experience.
This is because using imagery to convey information to the player benefits people with vision problems, as it can be hard to read text. It can also accomodate to people who speak a different language.
Images can convey meaning to anybody, regardless of a language barrier. Images can also be useful to aid people with a learning disability related to language.
The graphical style of the game will be a retro aesthetic, using a gritty color pallete that captures the big city aesthetic. Neon signs and flickering street lights will add ambience to the streets.
This color scheme will be paired with a grainy pixel art style, making use of the fine details in the art to create meaning in the world the player inhabits.


## Timetable

1. A core working program (done by two weeks before deadline): 
A barebones world with a top down camera, player movement, and combat with non player charachters. Limited to no assets, and placeholder shapes in place of objects, charachters, and NPCs.

2. A reasonable submission (done by one week before deadline): 
A somewhat more filled out world, with vehicle movement, missions, and interactive NPCs. Still little to no art, but beginning to introduce some assets into the game.

3. A well-polished submission (done by project deadline): 
Everything else above, with added sidequests, art, and secrets.
